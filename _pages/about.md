## About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/), where I work on projects ranging from using LLM's to improve the Enviornmental permitting process to developing simulation codes for improving energy efficiency at Commercial Ports. 

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech's [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), advised by [Haesun Park](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hpark/) and [Richard Vuduc](https://vuduc.org/v2/). My doctoral research was supported by the [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/).

## Current Work

At PNNL, I focus on:
- **LLM Development**: Fine-tuning and training large language models
- **Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Designing custom evaluation frameworks and LLM-as-Judge metrics for domain-specific applications
- **Infrastructure & Optimization**: Building scalable ML pipelines and optimizing compute infrastructure to help reduce project costs
- **Applied Research**: Working on research projects to help fufull DoE missions

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **high-performance computing**, and **data science**. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Large Language Models**: Training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of LLMs; long-context modeling
- **Scalable Machine Learning**: Designing algorithms that efficiently handle massive datasets and leverage parallel/distributed computing
- **Graph & Network Analysis**: Spectral methods, hypergraph clustering, and representation learning for complex relational data
- **Numerical Optimization**: Low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations with applications to dimension reduction and data mining
- **ML Systems & Infrastructure**: Building robust, efficient pipelines that enable research at scale

The common thread in my work is developing **principled, scalable methods** that combine strong theoretical foundations with practical performance—whether that's training models on thousands of GPUs or clustering networks with millions of nodes.

## Open Source & Impact

I'm a contributor to [PLANC](https://github.com/ramkikannan/planc), an open-source C++ library for scalable non-negative matrix factorization and dimension reduction.

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).
