excerpt: 'We present the first two algorithms for randomized Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. Our methods lead to 5.5-7.5x speed up on large graph datasets and preserve found clustering quality. Additionally, we prove theoretical results for our methods, guaranteeing accuracy with high probability.'
